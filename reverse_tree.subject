Implement a function to reverse a binary tree (i.e., flip it from right to left).

You must declare the following node structure for the binary tree in your code:


        struct s_node {
                int           value;
                struct s_node *right;
                struct s_node *left;
        };


The function must be declared as follows:

        void reverse_tree(struct s_node *root);

You must include the struct in your file.

EXAMPLE :

        The following tree :

               94
               / \
              /   \
             34   52
            / \
           /   \
          1    99
         /     / \
        20    /   \
             /     \
            83     39
             \     / \
             61   /   \
                 37   67

        would become :

              94
              / \
             /   \
            52   34
                 / \
                /   \
               99    1
              / \     \
             /   \    20
            /     \
           39     83
          / \     /
         /   \   61
        67   37
