The goal of this exercise is to find all possible answers to the following
equation :

        AB + CA = n

where A, B, and C are individual digits [0-9] and n is an integer.

Note that here AB is not the product of A and B. It is merely a two digit number
with A being the first digit (tens place) and B the second digit (ones place).

Implement a function that, given an integer n, prints on the standard
output all the possible values of A, B, C for which the equation is true.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void    equation(int n);

If a solution could not be found, nothing is printed.

Examples:

For the value n = 42, the output would be :

$> ./equation 42
A = 0, B = 2, C = 4
A = 1, B = 1, C = 3
A = 2, B = 0, C = 2
A = 3, B = 9, C = 0
$>

For the value n = 111, the output would be :

$> ./equation 111
A = 2, B = 9, C = 8
A = 3, B = 8, C = 7
A = 4, B = 7, C = 6
A = 5, B = 6, C = 5
A = 6, B = 5, C = 4
A = 7, B = 4, C = 3
A = 8, B = 3, C = 2
A = 9, B = 2, C = 1
$>

For the value n = 0, the output would be :

$> ./equation 0 | cat -e
A = 0, B = 0, C = 0$
$>

Note:

- The displayed output will always be sorted in ascending order beginning with A, then B and then C.
(as shown in the examples above)
