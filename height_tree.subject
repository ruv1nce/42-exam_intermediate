Implement a function to calculate the height of an n-ary tree.

Your should use the following node structure in your code for the n-ary tree:

        struct s_node {
                int           value;
                struct s_node **nodes;
        };

In this struct nodes is a null-terminated array.

Note that the height of a tree is the number of EDGES on the longest path from
the root node to a leaf. A tree with a single node will have a height of 0.

An empty tree should have height -1;

The function must be declared as follows:

        int height_tree(struct s_node *root);

EXAMPLE:

The Input Tree :

           94
           / \
          /   \
         34   52
        / \     \
       /   \     \
      1    99    11
                 /
                /
               13
Output : 3
