--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program that takes as a parameter two strings that represent two
numbers potentially infinit, and displays on stdout the result of the addition
of these two numbers, followed by a '\n'.
A negative number will always be prefixed by one and only one -. The only
characters that can be part of the strings are digits and the sign -.
Both parameters will always be well formated, and you will always have
exactly two parameters, no tricks.
Example:
$> ./infin_add "879879087" "67548976597" | cat -e
68428855684$
$> ./infin_add "-876435" "987143265" | cat -e
986266830$
$> ./infin_add "-807965" "-34532"
-842497
