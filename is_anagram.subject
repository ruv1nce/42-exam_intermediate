ALERT: OPTIMIZED SOLUTION REQUIRED.

An anagram is a sequence of characters formed by rearranging the letters of
another sequence, such as 'cinema', formed from 'iceman'.

Given two strings as parameters, create a function able to tell whether or
not the first string is an anagram of the second.

The function must be declared as follows:

int        is_anagram(char *a, char *b);

Considerations:

- Be careful: the naive solution won't work on our big input, you have to
find an optimized solution which will run in O(sa + sb) time (where sa is
the length of a and sb length of b).
- Our tested string will always be a sequence of ascii characters between 32
and 126 inclusive.
- The bigger test we will do is on 2 sequences of 1.000.000 characteres each.
It should run in less than 2 seconds.

Example 1:

a='abcdef'
b='fabcde'

In this case, these two strings are anagrams, your function should return 1.

Example 2:

a='.123?.'
b='?321..'

In this case, these two strings are anagrams, your function should return 1.

Example 3:

a='abca'
b='bcab'

In this case, these two strings are not anagrams, your function should return 0.
