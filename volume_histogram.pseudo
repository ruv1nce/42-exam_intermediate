1. Find maximum bar height.
2. Pass histogram, size and height to another function so that both size and height can be used as lengths of a variable-length array.
3. In another function, declare a 2D char array with height and size as its lengths.
4. Draw the histogram (fill this newly created map, or grid, with spaces and hashes).
5. Iterate through each row of grid, left to right, and then right to left, filling cells which cannot hold water (because they are not located between two walls).
6. Count the remaining spaces in grid.
